# Group Expense Manager

Group expense manager is the easiest way to share expenses with friends and family and stop stressing about “who owes who.” 
Our mission is to reduce the stress and awkwardness that money places on our most important relationships.

#### It is great for:
- Roommates splitting rent and apartment bills
- Group trips around the world
- Splitting a vacation house for skiing or at the beach
- Weddings and bachelor/bachelorette parties
- Couples sharing relationship costs
- Friends and co-workers who go out to lunch or dinner together frequently
- Loans and IOUs between friends 
- And so much more

#### It is simple to use:
- Create groups for any splitting situation
- Add expenses.
- Expenses are backed up online so any everyone can log in, view their balances, and add expenses
- Keep track of who should pay next, or settle up by recording cash payments.
